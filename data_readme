1.rawdata file contains the csv raw data;

2. emotiv_7sub_5class, 7sub, each 34560 samples,  the data in this file folders, are ordered by label.  
Each row of the data contain 16 elements: 1-14 are denote 14 channel EEG raw data, the 15th denotes the label of classes, the 16th column denotes the lable of subject.

3. The sampling rate is 128Hz.

4. The lable of subjects:
	1.  xiang Zhang
	2.  xigang Yuan
	3.  xiaoqing Zhang
	4.  Dalin Zhang
	5.  xiaodong Ning
	6.  manqing Dong
	7.  kaixuan Chen

5. The label of actions: 
	up:1
	down: 2
	left:3
	right:4 
	middle: 5
	eye close: 6

6. Please note, in the Percom 2018 paper, we removed the 5-th action for low SNR and only use the signals from labels: 1,2,3,4,6.  In our paper, the five selected actions are relabelled as 0-4 (Table II in paper). In your own work, you can use all the 6 categories or select seveal actions as a subset.

7. The channels named: AF3 F7 F3 FC5 T7 P7 O1 O2 P8 T8 FC6 F4 F8 AF4
